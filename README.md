# Comparing Metaheuristics to solve the Maximum Independent Set Problem

This repository includes the source code for my implementation of two different metaheuristics, Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search.

It has been developed as coursework for the *Algorithms and Combinatorial Optimisation* course as part of the M2 GENIOMHE under the supervision of Prof. Franck Delaplace. 

# Usage 

## Installation

To clone this repository, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
$ git clone 
```
`algorithms/` contains the scripts of `geneticalgo.py` and `tabu_search.py`


# The Maximum Independent Set problem

In graph theory, an independent set $S$ of a given graph $G=(V,E)$ is a number of vertices $v \in V$ such that no two vertices in $S$ are adjacent, i.e. that no edges $e \in E$ are shared.
*The Maximum Independent Set* (MIS) is the largest possible set of $G$. It can be defined as:

- $V' \subseteq V$ such that $\forall i, j \in V'$ the edge $\langle i, j \rangle \notin E$ and $|V'|$ is maximum (see BÃ¤ck & Khuri (1994))


## Small graph as an example:


The MIS is deemed NP-hard. You can find a `misp.ipynb` notebook comparing the performance of the Genetic Algorithm as well as Tabu Search in the `examples/` folder.
